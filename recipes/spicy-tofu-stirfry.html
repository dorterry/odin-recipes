    <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable stock</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

    <li>1/2 large red bell pepper, 1/2-inch dice</li>

    <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Prepare the baking sheets:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Line a large baking sheet with paper towels, have another baking sheet ready and a weight like a jar of sugar or flour.
  </p>
  
  <li><h4>Press the tofu:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Drain tofu and dry with paper towels. Arrange the tofu in a single layer on the baking sheet lined with paper towels. 
    Cover with additional paper towels. Place a second sheet pan on top. Place a heavy can or jar on the pan to lightly press
    out the excess moisture from the tofu. Leave it for about 10 minutes.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Dry the tofu:</h4></li>
  <p>
    After pressing, use dry paper towels to gently pat each piece of tofu dry to remove as much residual moisture as possible.
    Set the pieces aside on dry paper towels.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Make the sauce:</h4></li>
  <p>
    In a medium-sized bowl whisk together orange juice, vegetable broth, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, and garlic chili sauce. 
    In a small bowl whisk together cornstarch and water, set aside.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Fry the tofu:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Heat a wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 teaspoons vegetable oil and sesame oil and heat until 
    shimmering but not smoking. Swirl the pan to coat with the oil.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working in two batches, add tofu to the pan in a single layer. Cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip over
    and cook the other side until golden browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate lined with a paper towel, then fry the remaining tofu.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Stir-fry the vegetables:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the pan. Add the mushrooms and sugar snap peas, stir-fry for 2 minutes. 
    Add the diced bell peppers, cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger, stir-fry for 30 seconds.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Cook the sauce:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Add the sauce mixture to the pan, simmer for 30 seconds. Mix the cornstarch mixture, then gradually add to the pan, 
    stir constantly until thickened, about 30 seconds.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Add the tofu back to the pan:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Turn off the heat and add the tofu back to the pan, stir to coat and warm through, about 1 minute. 
    Season tofu stir-fry with salt, pepper, and garlic chili oil to taste.
  </p>

  <li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
  <p>
    Serve tofu stir-fry with rice and garnish with green onions.
