<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Roast the cubed eggplant:</h4>
  </li>
  <p>
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Scatter eggplant cubes in a shallow roasting
    pan and slather with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cover the pan with aluminum
    foil and bake for about 30 minutes, stirring once during the cooking. Remove
    from the oven and set aside.
  </p>
  <li>
    <h4>Sauté the onions, garlic, peppers:</h4>
  </li>
  <p>
    While the eggplant is roasting, start on the rest of the vegetables. In a
    large (5-6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil
    on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.
    Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about a minute more. Add the red
    bell peppers, zucchini, and jalapeño chili peppers. Cook for about 5 more
    minutes, stirring occasionally.
  </p>
  <li>
    <h4>Add the tomatoes, spices, chili, and roasted eggplant:</h4>
  </li>
  <p>
    Add the tomatoes to the pot along with any liquid that may have been in the
    can (if using canned). Add oregano, cumin, and fennel seeds. Add chili
    powder to desired heat. Stir in the eggplant cubes (carefully as to not
    break them up), and simmer for 20 minutes over low heat.
  </p>

  <li>
    <h4>Add the beans, lemon, sugar, cilantro, salt, pepper:</h4>
  </li>
  <p>
    Add the white beans and kidney beans, lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, and
    chopped cilantro. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Simmer for 5
    minutes.
  </p>
  <li>
    <h4>Serve with garnishes:</h4>
  </li>
  <p>Serve with sour cream, grated cheddar cheese, and chopped green onions.</p>
